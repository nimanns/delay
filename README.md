## A Basic Delay Plugin

A pretty basic delay plugin which is comprised of two delay modules each with highpass and lowpass filters, reverse and sync modes and parameter smoothing.
The functionality is pretty basic, the goal was to get my hands dirty and learn how circular buffers work using the book "Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by <em>Will C. Pirkle</em> 
as a guide.

1. Open the .jucer file using Projucer.
2. Configure your desired settings, save and open using your preferred IDE.
3. Build the standalone or the plugin version and give it a go!
